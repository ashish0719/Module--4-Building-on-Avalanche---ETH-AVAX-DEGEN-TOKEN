## Description

Minting: Only the owner can mint new tokens.
Burnable: Tokens can be burned when redeemed for items.
Transferable: Users can transfer tokens between accounts.
Fixed-Point (0 Decimals): Token balance does not have fractional units.
Redeemable: Users can exchange tokens for food items at fixed prices.
## Getting Started
### Executing program
1. Open Remix IDE at Remix.ethereum.org.
2. Create a new file and paste your DegenToken Solidity contract code.
3. Ensure that the code is free of any syntax or compilation errors by compiling it in Remix.
4. Install the MetaMask browser extension if you haven't already.
5. Open MetaMask and either create a new wallet or import an existing one.
6. Add a test network, such as Avalanche Fuji Testnet, to your MetaMask.
7. In Remix, go to the Deploy & Run Transactions tab.
8. In the environment dropdown, select Injected Web3, which connects Remix to your MetaMask account.
